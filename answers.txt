2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
fast-forward in Git can be used when we merge or rebase which is ahead of the one that we checked out.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Different branches are used to separate or distinguish between what is in development, what should be deployed, if anything needs to be fixed or new features are to be added.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
We can have as many Git repositories as we need but there should be only one origin
